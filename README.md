##EXP-3: PROMPT ENGINEERING
##Aim:

The aim of this experiment is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the most advanced 2024 prompting tools across diverse AI platforms. The selected platforms for this comparative analysis are:

ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Claude (Anthropic)

Bard (Google)

Cohere Command

Meta’s LLaMA

The core objective is to measure their performance, user experience, and response quality using two important real-world use cases:

Summarizing large documents

Answering technical questions

This evaluation will provide valuable insights for businesses, developers, and researchers, helping them choose the most suitable AI solution based on empirical data.

##Algorithm (Experiment Design):

The experiment follows a systematic step-by-step approach to ensure objective, consistent, and repeatable results.

Step 1: Platform Selection

Identify five prominent prompting platforms:
• ChatGPT (OpenAI)
• Claude (Anthropic)
• Bard (Google)
• Cohere Command
• Meta’s LLaMA (Open Source)

Step 2: Define Use Cases

Use Case 1: Document Summarization

Use Case 2: Technical Question Answering

Step 3: Data Preparation

Prepare identical datasets for consistent testing:
• 5 academic research articles
• 3 quarterly financial reports
• 20 technical questions in software and hardware domains

Step 4: Input Formatting

Summarization prompt format:
“Summarize the following document into a concise executive summary in less than 300 words.”

Technical question prompt format:
“Provide a detailed explanation of the following technical concept: [Insert Question].”

Step 5: Testing Environment Setup

All tests were conducted in a controlled environment to prevent external factors from skewing results.

Both API and web interfaces were used where available.

Step 6: Metrics for Evaluation

Each platform was assessed based on the following criteria:

Accuracy – How correct is the output compared to ground truth?

Conciseness – Does the summary eliminate unnecessary information?

Readability – Is the output clear and easy to understand?

Consistency – Does repeated querying yield stable responses?

Response Time – How fast is the result produced (in seconds)?

Adaptability – Can the tool handle various content types and complexities?

Interface Usability – How user-friendly is the platform’s interface and API?

Security Features – What data privacy mechanisms are in place?

Cost – What are the pricing structures?

Step 7: Data Collection

Each prompt was executed three times per platform to measure consistency.

Responses were logged in detail:
• Output content
• Time taken per query
• API response behavior
• Usability notes

Step 8: Data Analysis

Qualitative Analysis:
• Human reviewers rated readability, coherence, and overall usefulness.

Quantitative Analysis:
• Word count of responses
• Average response time
• Number of factual errors compared to ground truth.

Prompt (Example Prompts Used)
For Summarization (Use Case 1):

Prompt Example:
“Summarize the following research paper into an executive summary that highlights the research problem, methodology, key findings, and conclusion in no more than 300 words:
[Insert Research Paper Text]”

For Technical Question Answering (Use Case 2):

Prompt Example:
“What is the difference between multi-threading and multi-processing in computer programming? Please explain in simple terms and provide practical examples.”

##Output (Sample Observations)
✅ ChatGPT Sample Outputs

Summarization:
Provided detailed, coherent summaries in a conversational tone, often explaining complex concepts well but sometimes being verbose.

Example:
“This paper analyzes the evolution of neural networks from simple perceptron models to advanced transformer architectures. It demonstrates that transformers enable improved contextual understanding through attention mechanisms, allowing parallel data processing. The conclusion suggests focusing on model scalability in future research.”

Technical Answer:
Generally accurate but occasionally surface-level.
Example:
“Multi-threading allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously within the same process, sharing memory space. Multi-processing runs tasks in separate processes with independent memory, offering more stability at the cost of higher memory usage.”

✅ Claude Sample Outputs

Summarization:
Exceptionally structured and accurate.
Example:
“The study examines the development of neural network architectures, transitioning from perceptrons to transformers. Key findings include enhanced performance due to attention mechanisms and parallel processing. The conclusion emphasizes scalability as critical for future models.”

Technical Answer:
Detailed and structured.
Example:
“Multi-threading refers to the concurrent execution of threads within a single process sharing the same memory space. It is efficient but requires careful synchronization to prevent race conditions. Multi-processing involves separate processes with isolated memory, making it safer but more resource-intensive.”

✅ Bard Sample Outputs

Summarization:
Mixed quality, often pulling extraneous web data.
Example:
“Neural networks evolved. Attention mechanisms help in performance. Latest research points to scalability challenges. See [external link].”

Technical Answer:
Generic and surface-level.
Example:
“Multi-threading allows tasks to run in parallel. Multi-processing is about separate processes. See more online.”

✅ Cohere Command Sample Outputs

Summarization:
Highly efficient on structured data.
Example:
“Q2 Financial Summary: Revenue increased by 12%. Key cost drivers were operational expenses and R&D. Profit margins remained stable. Recommendations: Focus on market expansion.”

Technical Answer:
Precise but limited in explanation depth.
Example:
“Multi-threading is used for concurrent execution in applications. Multi-processing involves separate processes. Recommended for high-reliability systems.”

✅ Meta LLaMA Sample Outputs

Summarization:
Accurate but dense and lacking polish.
Example:
“Neural networks evolved from perceptrons → CNNs → Transformers. Attention mechanism enables parallel computation. Scalability is crucial.”

Technical Answer:
Detailed but jargon-heavy.
Example:
“Multi-threading leverages shared memory context switching within a single address space, allowing task-level parallelism. Multi-processing uses isolated memory spaces, preventing shared resource conflicts but increasing IPC overhead.”
